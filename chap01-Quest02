/** R-1.2 Suppose that we create an array A of GameEntry objects, which has an integer

*   mediately set A[4].score equal to 550, what is the score value of the GameEntry
*   object referenced by B[4]?
*/

// SOLUTION

public class GameEntryTest 
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        GameEntry[] a = new GameEntry[5];
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++ ){
            a[i] = new GameEntry((i+2)*3);
        }
        
        System.out.println("Array A created");
        System.out.println("a[4].score set to: " + a[4].getScore());
        
        System.out.println("Now lets clone array a to b.");
        GameEntry[] b = a.clone();
        
        System.out.println("Array A cloned to B.");
        System.out.println("b[4].score set to: " + b[4].getScore());
        
        System.out.println("Setting a[4].sscore to 550.");
        a[4].setScore(550);
        System.out.println("a[4].score set to: " + a[4].getScore());
        System.out.println("b[4].score set to: " + b[4].getScore());
    }
}

// ANSWER: Just the same because a[4] and b[4] are references to the same GameEntryObject.
