Solutions and Answers for the book's questions.

Here you will find some plausible solutions related to code itself instead theorical ones, not all, (because the solutions of some tasks are reach by doing a litte change on the prior solutions) for the book's questions. If you are a beginner programmer like me it would, and for sure will be useful. To put simply i don't want to pretend that it should be the definitive or the best solutions, just a key point to help you understand some basic aspects of the Java language and help you develop your own solutions.

About the solutions i just used what was coverded at each chapter. There are easy ways to solve almost all of those questions with the use of java class API.

Good coding!
