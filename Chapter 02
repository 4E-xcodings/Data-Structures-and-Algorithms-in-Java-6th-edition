R-2.3 Describe a component from a text-editor GUI and the methods that it encapsulates.


R-2.4 Assume that we change the CreditCard class (see Code Fragment 1.5) so that
instance variable balance has private visibility. Why is the following implementation of the PredatoryCreditCard.charge method flawed?

public boolean charge(double price) {
  boolean isSuccess = super.charge(price);
    if (!isSuccess)
      charge(5); // the penalty
  return isSuccess;
}

>Changing the superclass instance variable balance modifier assessor to private will not cause compile time error,
because charge's PredatoryCreditCard class method make a call to the superclass CreditCard method instead of trying access it directly.
On the other hand it will cause not a compile time error nor runtime exception but will not perform any charge after the limit is reached.
