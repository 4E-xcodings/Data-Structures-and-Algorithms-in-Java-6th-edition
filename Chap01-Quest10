/*
 * Write a Java class, Flower, that has three instance variables of type String, int,

 * each variable to an appropriate value, and your class should include methods for
 * setting the value of each type, and getting the value of each type.

// ANSWER

public class Flower {
    
    private String name;
    private int petals;
    private float price;
    
    public Flower(String name, int petals, float price){
        this.name = name;
        this.petals = petals;
        this.price = price;
    }
    
    public void setName(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }
    public void setPetals(int petals){
        this.petals = petals;
    }
    public void setPrice(float price){
        this.price = price;
    }
    public String getName(){
        return this.name;
    }
    public int getPetals(){
        return this.petals;
    }
    public float getPrice(){
        return this.price;
